# Model Implementation
This project includes the implementation of both linear regression and ridge regression. The models are designed to run concurrently, allowing the selection of the one that performs best based on the given dataset. To ensure robust performance assessment, k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping techniques were applied. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of each model.

### K-fold Cross-Validation
We integrated k-fold cross-validation, providing users the option to set the value of *k* according to their needs. This customization enhances the evaluation process, enabling it to align with the unique characteristics of the dataset and ensuring a comprehensive and flexible analysis of the model's performance across various data partitions.

### Bootstraping
We implemented bootstrapping, allowing users to specify the number of iterations for generating resampled datasets. This approach involves repeatedly sampling the training data with replacement and fitting the model on these resampled datasets. By evaluating the model's performance, such as calculating mean squared error (MSE) for predictions on the test set, this method provides a robust way to estimate the stability and reliability of the model's performance under varying data distributions.

### Do your cross-validation and bootstrapping model selectors agree with a simpler model selector like AIC in simple cases (like linear regression)?
In simple cases like linear regression, the cross-validation, bootstrapping, and AIC model selectors generally align, as all three methods aim to assess model performance in terms of its ability to fit the data while avoiding overfitting.

- **Cross-Validation**: By splitting the data into multiple folds and evaluating the model's mean squared error (MSE) on the validation set, k-fold cross-validation provides a robust estimate of the model's performance across different data splits.

- **Bootstrapping**: This method repeatedly samples the training data with replacement, fits the model, and evaluates its performance (e.g., MSE). It captures variability in model performance due to data sampling.

- **AIC**: AIC uses the MSE and penalizes model complexity based on the number of parameters. For linear regression, which typically has a straightforward relationship between features and output, AIC often agrees with the other methods because the MSE forms the foundation for its calculations.

Given the code provided:
- Both k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping rely on MSE for evaluation, similar to AIC. Hence, in simpler models like linear regression, these approaches are likely to identify the same optimal model because they evaluate similar metrics under slightly different conditions.
- The alignment may diverge in more complex scenarios, such as models with high regularization (e.g., ridge regression) or datasets with noise, where AICâ€™s penalty on model complexity could lead to different selections compared to resampling-based techniques.
