# model selection
This project focuses on developing custom approaches to model selection using a several datasets. Techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping, and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) are employed to analyze and compare various linear regression models. The primary aim is to provide a practical demonstration of implementing machine learning algorithms and performance metrics for both regression and classification problems, without relying on libraries like scikit-learn. This work underscores the importance of gaining an in-depth understanding of the core concepts underlying model selection and evaluation.

We implemented both linear regression and ridge regression, running the models simultaneously to determine the one best suited to the dataset. Performance evaluation was conducted using k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping, while the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was utilized to assess the quality of each model.
